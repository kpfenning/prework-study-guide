# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide webpage was created for students to keep their prework notes oragnized and easily accesible. The information during this course can feel overwhelming, so having a place for students to reference what was learned in the Prework lessons is very useful. Using a webpage to organize your notes will keep students from searching through all of their notes to find the information. Now they can just go to  this webpage and see all of it here! I learned countless things while creating this webpage, but the most important thing I learned is mastering the basics and fully understanding the terminology. Doing this will give you the needed foundation for success in the rest of the course.

## Usage

When using this webpage, you will find notes on the four main topics covered during the prework lessons; HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript. You can also open the DevTools console and see the Javascript running as well as see the list of the topics. It will even give you a suggestion on which topic you should study first!
